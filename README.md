Mancala AI with Minimax Alpha-Beta Pruning
An intelligent Mancala (Awalé) game implementation featuring an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning optimization.
📋 About
This project implements the traditional African board game Mancala (also known as Awalé) with an AI opponent. The computer player uses adversarial search techniques to make strategic decisions, providing a challenging gameplay experience.
🎮 Game Overview
Mancala is a sowing game played on a board with:

12 small pits (6 per player)
2 stores (one per player)
4 seeds in each pit at the start

Objective: Capture more seeds than your opponent by strategically sowing seeds around the board.
🤖 AI Implementation
The computer opponent uses:

Minimax Algorithm: For optimal decision-making in adversarial scenarios
Alpha-Beta Pruning: To optimize search efficiency by eliminating unnecessary branches
Heuristic Evaluation: Based on seed count difference between computer and human stores

📖 How to Play

Choose your side (Player 1 or Player 2)
On your turn, select a pit (A-F for Player 1, G-L for Player 2)
Seeds are distributed counterclockwise
Capture opponent's seeds by landing in an empty pit
Game ends when one player's pits are empty
Player with most seeds in their store wins
